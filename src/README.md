# 🌟 Stable Diffusion Templates

This is curated collection of templates for [Vast.ai](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/?ref_id=62878) and [Runpod.io](https://runpod.io/console/deploy?ref=gzvzzzv9) services. Their main purpose is to simplify the process of getting started with Stable Diffusion. These templates gives ready to use [Automatic1111 WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) thanks to [AI-Dock](https://github.com/ai-dock/stable-diffusion-webui). Plus they have some nice Lora's and useful Extensions preinstalled.

Mentioned services give you access to powerful GPUs like [RTX4090](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/) at low cost.

Additional informations will be added soon.

## 🗃 FAQ

`Q` Will you add more models?  
`A` Yes. Currently I need to create templates manually, because these services does not provide API for managing templates. Believe me, it's a pain.

`Q` Will you add checkpoint X?  
`A` Please [open an discussion](https://github.com/Avaray/stable-diffusion-templates/discussions/new?category=ideas). But keep in mind that model must be battle tested on [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models).

`Q` Will you add more services?  
`A` Maybe. Currently I don't know any better or at least as good as current ones.
